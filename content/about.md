Finding a coherent and complete future proof solution to a question is what gives me energy.
Whether it results in an implementation, architecture description or the choice to purchase an existing solution,
what matters is whether it addresses the problem at hand in an efficient and optimal way.

In the past five years I grew from a developer to a solution architect and technical product owner.
My goal for the next few years is to extend my skills by creating more solutions and in different challenging contexts,
and to use my background in machine learning to specialize in the architecture of big data and machine learning solutions.
